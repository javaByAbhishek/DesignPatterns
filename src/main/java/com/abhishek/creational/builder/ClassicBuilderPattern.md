# Classic Builder Pattern

The Classic Builder Pattern is a design pattern that simplifies the construction of complex objects. This pattern allows for a clear and manageable way to create objects with multiple optional parameters.

## Key Considerations for the Classic Builder Pattern

### 1. Private Constructor
Ensure that the constructor of the outer class is private or package-private to prevent direct instantiation.

### 2. Static Builder Class
Define a static inner Builder class that contains the same fields as the outer class, managing the construction of the outer class's instance.

### 3. Fluent Interface
Implement fluent methods in the Builder class that return the Builder instance itself (`this`). This allows method chaining for improved readability.

### 4. Build Method
Include a `build()` method in the Builder class to validate and return a new instance of the outer class.

### 5. Default Values
Consider initializing optional fields in the Builder class with default values to simplify object creation.

### 6. Immutability
Design the outer class to be immutable after construction, ensuring that its state cannot be altered.

### 7. Encapsulation
Keep the logic for building the object encapsulated within the Builder class.

## Example Implementation

Here’s a simple example demonstrating the Classic Builder Pattern:

```java
public class Post {
    private final String title;
    private final String content;
    private final String author;

    // Private constructor
    private Post(Builder builder) {
        this.title = builder.title;
        this.content = builder.content;
        this.author = builder.author;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String title;
        private String content;
        private String author;

        // Fluent method to set title
        public Builder setTitle(String title) {
            this.title = title;
            return this;
        }

        // Fluent method to set content
        public Builder setContent(String content) {
            this.content = content;
            return this;
        }

        // Fluent method to set author
        public Builder setAuthor(String author) {
            this.author = author;
            return this;
        }

        // Build method with validation
        public Post build() {
            if (title == null || content == null || author == null) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Title, content, and author cannot be null.");
            }
            return new Post(this);
        }
    }
}
```
### Here’s how you would use the Post class with the Builder:

```java
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Post post = new Post.Builder()
.setTitle("My First Post")
.setContent("This is the content of my first post.")
.setAuthor("John Doe")
.build();

        System.out.println("Post created: " + post);
    }
}
```
