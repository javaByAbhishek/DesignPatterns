# Factory Method Pattern vs. Abstract Factory Pattern

The **Factory Method Pattern** and the **Abstract Factory Pattern** are related design patterns in the realm of object creation, but they serve different purposes and have distinct structures.

## Key Differences

### Purpose

- **Factory Method Pattern**:
    - Focuses on creating a single product or a family of related products through a single method in a creator class.
    - Allows subclasses to override the method to specify which product to create.

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**:
    - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    - Typically involves multiple factory methods for creating different types of products.

### Structure

- **Factory Method Pattern**:
    - Involves a single factory method in an abstract class (or interface) that is overridden in concrete subclasses.
    - Each subclass is responsible for creating a specific product.

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**:
    - Consists of multiple factory methods within an abstract factory class (or interface).
    - Concrete factory classes implement these methods to create a set of related products.

### Use Cases

- **Factory Method Pattern**:
    - Useful when you want to delegate the instantiation of a single type of object to subclasses.

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**:
    - Useful when you need to create families of related products, ensuring that they are compatible with one another.

## Summary

In summary, while both patterns facilitate object creation and promote loose coupling, the **Factory Method Pattern** is designed for individual product creation, whereas the **Abstract Factory Pattern** is intended for creating families of related products.
